    "Question/need:\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the framing question of your analysis, or the purpose of the model/system you plan to build?\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem: The New York Marketing Firm (NYMF) wants to place advertisements for their client Feel, a health technology company with a new product (wearable device) that allows people to share their psychological state/emotions with a provider. They want to know in which MTA stations should they purchase ad-spaces to maximize consumer exposure. \n",
    "\n",
    "Who benefits from exploring this question or building this model/system?\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: NYMF gets a good ad placement. Feel gets their product promoted. Providers gain a more efficient and accurate way to help their patients. Responsibility for a patient to accurately describe their state of mind is reduced.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Data Description: \n",
    "\n",
    "What dataset(s) do you plan to use, and how will you obtain the data?\n",
    "- Use MTA data from the year 2021-2022 obtained from MTA turnstile data\n",
    "\n",
    "What is an individual sample/unit of analysis in this project? What characteristics/features do you expect to work with?\n",
    "If modeling, what will you predict as your target?\n",
    "- analyze traffic into and out of each station to determine heavy/light flow during rush-hour times 8/9am, 5/6pm and midday 12-2pm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Tools:\n",
    "\n",
    "How do you intend to meet the tools requirement of the project?\n",
    "- use Pandas and Matplotlib for EDA and graphs\n",
    "- git/github for code upload/storing\n",

    "Are you planning in advance to need or use additional tools beyond those required?\n",
